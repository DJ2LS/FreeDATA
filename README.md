# FreeDATA
My attempt to create a free and open-source TNC with a GUI for [codec2](https://github.com/drowe67/codec2) with the idea of sending messages and data from one network based application.

## Under development
Please keep in mind, that this project is still a prototype with many issues which need to be solved.
Build steps for other OS than Ubuntu are provided, but not fully working, yet.
